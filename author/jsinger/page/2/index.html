<p><span data-sheets-value="[null,2,&quot;Abstract\u2014The National Cyber Range (NCR) is an innovative Department of Defense (DoD) resource originally established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and now under the purview of the Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) (a Field Activity of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics [OUSD (AT&amp;L)]). It provides a unique environment for cybersecurity testing throughout the program development life cycle using unique methods to assess resiliency to advanced cyberspace security threats. This presentation describes what a cybersecurity range is, how it might be employed, and the advantages can be gained in applying the results of range events. Creating realism in a test environment isolated from the operational environment is a special challenge in cyberspace. Representing the scale and diversity of the complex DoD communications networks at a fidelity detailed enough to realistically portray current and anticipated attack strategies (e.g., malware, distributed denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting) is complex. The NCR addresses this challenge by representing an Internet-like environment by employing a multitude of virtual machines and physical hardware augmented with traffic emulation, port/protocol/service vulnerability scanning, and data capture tools. This presentation provides an overview of the operation of the NCR.

It provides a unique environment for cybersecurity testing throughout the program development life cycle using unique methods to assess resiliency to advanced cyberspace security threats. This presentation describes what a cybersecurity range is, how it might be employed, and the advantages can be gained in applying the results of range events. Creating realism in a test environment isolated from the operational environment is a special challenge in cyberspace. Representing the scale and diversity of the complex DoD communications networks at a fidelity detailed enough to realistically portray current and anticipated attack strategies (e.g., malware, distributed denial of service attacks, cross-site scripting) is complex.

<p>This talk is broken into 3 succinct interwoven topics.</p>
<p>#1. Culture &#8211; (Our Backstory) We build our leaders to deal with failure as a painful event. Should we fire someone that is involved in an incident? What if the person does it again? The damage is done, the pain is suffered, the person who is &#8216;fired&#8217; or who&#8217;s performance review is subject to this, has perverse incentives. That doesn&#8217;t work. Culture plays a role in our work lives and how we treat failure serves as the backstory for much of this talk.<br />
#2. Regulation &#8211; (Our Villan)&#8230; Our government may drive our industry into regulation. regulation. The attempt to bring some level &#8216;of sameness&#8217; through laws, and the government has been attempted before. No one will go into a plane that falls out of the sky, seat belts or car designs also save lives, does software follow? Is regulation villain, friend, or foe?<br />
#3. Transparency &#8211; (The Jedi) We are not learning because our industry doesn&#8217;t share, how do we expect to fix the issues if from the top down bottom up we aren&#8217;t learning?<br />
Our industry has enjoyed a pretty deregulated environment for the majority of its existence. I believe we have ways that have worked in the business world that could translate to the security world&#8230; or maybe there are ways that come from the safety world that translate to the security world? Either way, if we don&#8217;t act at some point our industry will face deep deep regulation as we will not have proven that we can collectively govern ourselves.</p>
<p>Call to action and calamity ensues.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago the field of computer security was largely limited to operating systems security and network security, with cryptography a closely related topic but not integral to the field.  Now, it’s far broader, covering not only technical topics, but also a broad range of related areas including many social science areas and usable security.  In this talk, I’ll give some examples of how social science affects the technical aspects of cybersecurity research, and how the two aspects need to work together going forward.  I’ll also describe how NSF funding is helping to move these fields together.</p>
