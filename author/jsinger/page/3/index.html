<p>If watching hours of Science Fiction has taught us anything, then it is the fact that world will at some point been taken over by machines. How far have modern technologies come to some of these scenarios? Do machines start to form a plan to take over like Cylons in Battlestar Galactica? Does our future begin with a choice or is resistance futile? A number of different technologies have emergent recently to infiltrate more and more of our daily lives. From the “quantified self”, to the “Internet of Things” and new protocols like IPv6 to scale and integrate networks by orders of magnitude. At the same time, networks are more and more the focus of political and influence, and various powers look to them to implement politics by other means. In this talk, we will illustrate how much these technologies already control and meter what we do and how machine decisions influence our daily lives. Securing these technologies will have to balance privacy and reliability while being still convenient to use.</p>

<p>Every year, software security becomes more complex. New attack strategies are discovered, old ones are rediscovered, and the taxonomy of insecurity balloons exponentially. How can someone manage all of this information?</p>
<p>Resonant Core&#8217;s application security specialist, Scott, proposes three distinct areas where the lion&#8217;s share of security problems exist, with real-world examples from software we use every day. He also discusses the role of compliance audits as a baseline and the importance of security engineering in business.</p>

In the end, we will take possession of the controllers and make unexpected. There will be a smattering of codes for metasploit that will be demonstrated. Does a controller can control us? We'll see.\n\n&lt;off&gt;\nA theme not so new but little researched in offensive security conferences, this lecture will be something like a kickoff for more research in this platform that is increasingly widespread among large manufacturers in the market. SDN is very complex as it relates to their design, initially the idea of computer networking were keeping concentrators of the networks (those responsible for making all types of handling in the life of a package) in physical devices or stocky hardware's. Today the main idea behind the SDN architecture, is to raise the level of abstraction to a point that is easily to program something with efficiency in its alteration causing the least possible downtime. We know that applications are most responsible for hacker attacks. Lack of authentication, APIs without protection, default installation settings, no hardening, are just some of the entry points that an attacker can explore to find vital information of an organization. How will the SDN behave towards these issues as explored for several years?\n\nThis talk will focus on some of these points. We'll  see how to identify existing controllers on the network, what are your standard ports and identify the services running there. For this task, a module for metasploit was developed to manage the identification of SDN controllers from different vendors. The next step is to obtain essential information on controllers so we can proceed to the next step, which is to control the controllers. Here we will use some of the metasploit modules, which will gather information from large vendors of controllers, such as HP VAN SDN, Oracle SDN Controller, Juniper Contrail and open-source controllers also, as Floodlight, OpenDayLight and OpenContrail.\nTo finish this talk, it will be demonstrated what a controller shouldn't allow us to do on a network with an active controller and the risks and impacts that can have on an organization. It's not the primary goal but suggestions to protect and make the SDN environment safer will be mentioned at the end.\n\nI have some videos as PoC, if deemed necessary.\n&lt;/off&gt;&quot;]" data-sheets-userformat="[null,null,515,[null,0],[null,2,65280],null,null,null,null,null,null,null,0]">SDN (Software Defined Network) has attracted the attention of many technology giants from various segments such as VMware, Juniper, Cisco, HP, IBM, Google, China Telecom, Huawei and others by providing more virtualized services that can be scheduled, managed and monitored faster, more efficient and in a less costly manner than the usual solutions.

<p>Business Intelligence is one of the many powerful types of information we can gather on targets through reconnaissance. However, besides using search engines, many of the sites available either have restrictions in place to try and protect customer data or have API services which require paying for credits. As hackers, it is in our nature to try and evade these types of restrictions in order to obtain the data we are in need of.</p>
<p>We will cover some different approaches for gathering business intelligence through OSINT resources as well a specific example on how to evade and abuse the weak business processes that have been put in place by LinkedIn to protect information from 3+ degree connections. I will demonstrate a case example of bypassing and abusing LinkedIn business processes to gather intelligence on your target. Who said reconnaissance can&#8217;t be sexy?</p>
