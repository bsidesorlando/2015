<p>A lot of people have talked about the potential of mobile malware. This is real stuff. In this talk we look at tools and techniques that have been used in the wild and draw some conclusions. Example of a skyrocketing (and profitable) malware threat, one technique for distributing malware and one piece of malware you willingly install on your phone.</p>
