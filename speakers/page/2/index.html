<p>This talk is broken into 3 succinct interwoven topics.</p>
<p>#1. Culture &#8211; (Our Backstory) We build our leaders to deal with failure as a painful event. Should we fire someone that is involved in an incident? What if the person does it again? The damage is done, the pain is suffered, the person who is &#8216;fired&#8217; or who&#8217;s performance review is subject to this, has perverse incentives. That doesn&#8217;t work. Culture plays a role in our work lives and how we treat failure serves as the backstory for much of this talk.<br />
#2. Regulation &#8211; (Our Villan)&#8230; Our government may drive our industry into regulation. regulation. The attempt to bring some level &#8216;of sameness&#8217; through laws, and the government has been attempted before. No one will go into a plane that falls out of the sky, seat belts or car designs also save lives, does software follow? Is regulation villain, friend, or foe?<br />
#3. Transparency &#8211; (The Jedi) We are not learning because our industry doesn&#8217;t share, how do we expect to fix the issues if from the top down bottom up we aren&#8217;t learning?<br />
Our industry has enjoyed a pretty deregulated environment for the majority of its existence. I believe we have ways that have worked in the business world that could translate to the security world&#8230; or maybe there are ways that come from the safety world that translate to the security world? Either way, if we don&#8217;t act at some point our industry will face deep deep regulation as we will not have proven that we can collectively govern ourselves.</p>
<p>Call to action and calamity ensues.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago the field of computer security was largely limited to operating systems security and network security, with cryptography a closely related topic but not integral to the field.  Now, it’s far broader, covering not only technical topics, but also a broad range of related areas including many social science areas and usable security.  In this talk, I’ll give some examples of how social science affects the technical aspects of cybersecurity research, and how the two aspects need to work together going forward.  I’ll also describe how NSF funding is helping to move these fields together.</p>

<p>If watching hours of Science Fiction has taught us anything, then it is the fact that world will at some point been taken over by machines. How far have modern technologies come to some of these scenarios? Do machines start to form a plan to take over like Cylons in Battlestar Galactica? Does our future begin with a choice or is resistance futile? A number of different technologies have emergent recently to infiltrate more and more of our daily lives. From the “quantified self”, to the “Internet of Things” and new protocols like IPv6 to scale and integrate networks by orders of magnitude. At the same time, networks are more and more the focus of political and influence, and various powers look to them to implement politics by other means. In this talk, we will illustrate how much these technologies already control and meter what we do and how machine decisions influence our daily lives. Securing these technologies will have to balance privacy and reliability while being still convenient to use.</p>
